# Whack-a-Mole

This is a fun, interactive Whack-a-Mole browser game where players can click on moles to score points and avoid the dangerous plants that end the game. The game includes a timer, a scoreboard, and a leaderboard to keep track of top scores. The game has been optimised for mobile and desktop with accessible controls and visual feedback.

1. Scoring:

- Click on the mole tiles to score points. Each mole is worth 10 points.
- Avoid clicking on the plant tiles—hitting a plant ends the game immediately.

2. Timer:

- Each game lasts for 30 seconds. When the timer reaches zero, the game ends and displays your score.
